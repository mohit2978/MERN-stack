# Ep-2 JS on server 

Now With NodeJs,JS can run on server

## What is server?
A computer or CPU located somewhere (remotely)!! A CPU or computer receiving request is server!!

When we run some website , that website is hosted on some server, so from that server we get that website and as we are getting that from server ,we are known as client !! 

`Now with Nodejs ,Js was able to run on server`!!
 With JS come on backend and frontedn so one developer can write code on both frontend and backend so can be ful-stack developer!!

 MERN --> MongoDb Express React Node


Nodejs is Cpp code!! JS engine Chrome V8 also written in cpp!! can see repository on github of v8 , you see it is cpp program!! 

`V8 can be embedded in any Cpp application`!! V8 engine executes JS !! 

V8 written in JS converts JS into Machine code!!

`V8 can be embedded in any Cpp application` so this lead to creation of node js !! Nodejs is another cpp program that has V8 embedded in it!!

## when V8 can execute JS why we need Nodejs ,we can just put V8 on server and execute JS??

V8 is JS-engine following ECMAscript standard!!! ECMAscript is standard (rule-book) followed by JS!! JS engines follow these standards!!

ES6--> ecmascript standard version 6

NodeJs does not only have V8,it has several other things like API on server !!example V8 cannot connect to Db ,cannot connect to other Computer by IP,cannot get image from Folder as these are not in ECMA script standard!!

only thing V8 can do is run core JS which follow ECMAscript standard!!

so Nodejs along with V8 has API on server!!This is known as `JS runtime`!!

These API's written in JS only!! can see code on repository!!

Cpp is High level Lanaguage ,V8 is written in Cpp ,V8 takes up JS code and convert to machine code!!

`Can check code of nodejs on github and check in deps (dependency) folder , you will find v8 dependency!`
