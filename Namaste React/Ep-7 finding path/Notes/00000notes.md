# Ep-7 finding path (routing)

Routing among different pages in react!!
## useEffect working!!
 we know syntax of useEffect!! 

 ```text
useEffect(callback function, dependencies?)
 ```
 ```jsx
useEffect(()=>{},[])
 ```
 useEffect is called after every render of component!! Dependency array chnage behaviour of useEffect!!

>Note:if no dependency array ,useEffect is called at every render!! 

>Note:If empty dependency array is empty then useEffect is called on initial render and just once!!Now it will not be called even if component re-renders!!

what if we put something in dependency array , so now on dependency change ,useEffect will be called!!
