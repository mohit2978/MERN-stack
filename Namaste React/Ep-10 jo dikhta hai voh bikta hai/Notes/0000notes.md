How to make app look beautiful!!Till now we have used simple CSS!!

In prd we generally ue Styled-components or MUI (Material UI) or Chakra UI or tailwind!! 

MUI gives component out of the box!! They give pre-styled components !! They give components which are already very beautiful!!It has css in it!!

Along With MUI ,poeple use bootstrap,tailwind and other CSS frameworks!!

Ant Design is another framework used!!
