# Ep-13 time to test

We know testing is very important !! Testing is a huge Domain!! We only concerned about Developer testing !!

Even a single line of code can put bug anywhere !! When we have 100's of components !!and these components talk to each other!!

Developer can do 
- `manual tetsing`--> like we do by doing that specific action 

- `write code to test the application`
