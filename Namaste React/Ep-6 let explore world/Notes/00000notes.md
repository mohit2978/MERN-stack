# Ep-6

We know Monolithic vs Microservices !!

On monolithic everyone was having same github repository!! Now in microservices backedn needs to call to APIs!! So we will see it now!!

2 ways to fetch data from backend!!

1. as soon as page loads make API call,wait for data to come and then render UI!! so here need to wait for API response!!

2. as soon as page loads ,Render UI!!after rendering UI we make API call ,after we get data ,we re-render the UI!!

In react we using 2nd approach always!!2nd one give better UX !! we do not use 1st one ,we use 2nd one as first we see skeleton and then we see the data!! so here user do not see any lag!!2 renders are okay !! We need not worry for that!!
