# Episode-5 lets get hooked

React like framework makes devloper's life easy and evn optimises the code!!
We will see React Hooks today!!

Always make separate files for spearate components!! All code inside `src` folder!!

>Note: React does not have any opinion about folder structure!!You can have any folder structure ,no standard way!!`Only file name should be same as functional component` as it twll what a component have!!

>Note:file extension js or jsx or tsx(for typescript) can be there !!No debates ,can use any!! It does not matter!!
## export and import 

In import you no need to put file extension (js and jsx) ,if you even put ,it will make no difference!!Better keep it simple do not put extension!!

>Note:For importing css you just need to import css no need to put use this!!

>Note:Never put hardcoded data in component folder!!Keep it in separate folder!! keep in utils or config foler !!Put the file name in small letters only Component shouydl be in Capital letters!!

export are of two types 
1. default export --> can be exported only once in a file!!
2. named export --> multiple things to export in a file!! below is example of named export

```js
export const LOGO_URL="https://png.pngtree.com/png-vector/20220623/ourmid/pngtree-food-logo-png-image_5296974.png";

export const tmp="temp";
```

Below you can see how to import and use named export 

```js
import './Header.css';
import {LOGO_URL} from '../utils/constants.js'
const Header = () => {
    return (
        <div className="header">
            <div className="logo">
                <img src={LOGO_URL} alt="logo" />
            </div>
            <div className="navItems">
              <ul>
                  <li>Home</li>
                  <li>About Us</li>
                  <li>Contact</li>
                  <li>Cart</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}

```
>Note: rememeber LOGO_URL is a constant so need to use {} around it!!

for default export we do not use `{}`,Good practice is use deafult export for components!!

>Note:In companies we have to put a component below 100 lines!!

### Ques. Can we use both exports with one another??
