# Ep-3 laying the foundation!!

Previously we have use `npx parcel <html-file>` to run in development build and hosted on localhost !!

npx parcel --> executing a npm package parcel with index.html!!

we will create npm scripts to run react program in package.json instead of writing `npx parcel ` again and again!!

we change our filename to run to index.html and provide scripts in package.json

```json
{
  "name": "namaste_project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "first project",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "runprd": "parcel build index.html",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "namaste",
    "project"
  ],
  "author": "Mohit",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.15.2",
    "react": "^19.1.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.1.0"
  }
}
```

now in company if you do not know how to run project go to package.json and there you find scripts and there you see command to run code!!
