# Ep-9 optimizing App

Let us see how we optimise our app !! We know What SRP(Single Responsibility Principle) means!! So here each component should have single responsibility!! 

We break code into Modules so that we can create test case and bug can be caught by just testing this component!!

If you follow SRP , your code become more reusable , mainatianble and testable!!

SRP dot have some rules , but code should be as light as possible!!

Today we will see Custom Hooks (normal JS functions ) !!Hook is normal utility function!! We will take our some thing from some component and create hook so that our code becomes more modular!!
